# What happened to my Neighbors?
### How the biggest memorial in the world reminds us of victims of the Nazis in many German cities and all over Europe.
### What we can learn about them and our neighborhoods.

I actually went on a walk through my neighbourhood and took photos of every "Stumbling Stone". But I also scraped wikipedia â€“ first I did that only for Hamburg-Wilhelmsburg then I scraped all of the pages for "Stumbling Stones" in Hamburg for every borough and district. Because my scraper did not work for every borough in Hamburg I decided to show a map of "Stumbling Stones" in Berlin (I found a csv on their open data website). 

The dataset for Berlin is good to show the locations and to see in which boroughs and districts are the most. Also I found out which names where most comon among the victims. But it did not give me the inscription of the stones. 

If I had more time, I would analyse all the inscriptions. I can find out more about the age, when the people were deported and to which concentration camps and other destinations they were brought.

For my neighbourhood I researched the background of the victims: How many of them were jewish people, who was an activist in a resistance group and who was deported for being homosexual. These informations are not in the inscriptions. I got them by reading the biographies.

Since the memorial is an art project that is not complete yet I would like to compare the data from the "Stumbling Stones" with other datasets on this topic.
