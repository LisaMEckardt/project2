# What happened to my Neighbors?
### How the biggest memorial in the world reminds us of victims of the Nazis in many German cities and all over Europe.
### What we can learn about them and our neighborhoods.

I actually went on a walk through my neighbourhood and took photos of every stumbling stone. But I also scraped wikipedia – first I did that only for Hamburg-Wilhelmsburg then I scraped all of the pages for stumbling stones in Hamburg for every borough and district. 

Because my scraper did not work in the beginning for every borough in Hamburg I decided to show a map of stumbling stones in Berlin (I found a csv on their open data website). The dataset for Berlin is good to show the locations and to see in which boroughs and districts are the most. Also I found out which names where most common among the victims. But it did not give me the inscription of the stones. 

If I had more time, I would analyse all the inscriptions. I can find out more about the age, when the people were deported and to which concentration camps and other destinations they were brought. I started to do that for Hamburg. But I have to find out more about the inscriptions before I can analyse them in depth.

For my neighborhood I researched the background of the victims: How many of them were jewish people, who was an activist in a resistance group and who was deported for being homosexual. These informations are not in the inscriptions. I got them by reading the biographies.

Also I want to find out more about the process of their installation. The stones are usually donated by organizations and private people. In my neighborhood there are just a few stones – is that because there were fewer victims or because there are less donors?

Since the memorial is an art project that is not complete yet I would like to compare the data from the stumbling stones with other datasets on this topic.
